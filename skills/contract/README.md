# contract

**People ask for help in human language, and an agent needs exact instructions.**

A person who wants a reusable helper usually writes a prompt. They paste it
again and again, and edit it when it goes wrong. The prompt drifts. Nobody
can say which line holds which decision, or why. A day later, the person who
decided often cannot say either.

contract closes that gap. The person does not write a prompt. The person
agrees terms, and the skill writes the prompt from those terms. The terms,
and the history of why each one was decided, stay beside the prompt.

The contract reads like an employment contract, and the skill works like a
hiring interview: `purpose` is the job offer, `why` is why you are hiring,
`good` is what great work looks like, `roles` holds the duties, sign-offs and
stops, `tools` the keys and access, `rules` the house rules, `writing` the
house style, and `open` the probation. A *Proposed* answer is the draft offer; **Confirmed**
is signed as offered; **Decided** is a term you negotiated.

## Use it

Ask for it by name. The installer route keeps the plain name; the plugin route
namespaces it:

```text
/contract <the skill or agent you want>
/grimoire:contract <the skill or agent you want>
```

Or let it step in. It steps in when a person wants to build a reusable skill
or agent, for a prompt they keep pasting, and for a change to a skill, agent
or CLAUDE.md that has a contract. It stays out of a one-off prompt, and of a
request to run a skill or agent that already exists.

**Read before you install.** Read a shared skill, agent or CLAUDE.md and its
contract before you use it, as you would any code from someone else.

**The hiring page keeps your answers, unencrypted.** When you say yes to the
notice (below), the page keeps your answers in your browser until you press
**Reset** on it. Other pages opened from disk in the same
browser, browser extensions with file access, programs running as you and
backups of your browser profile can read them. Reset removes them from the
page's store; your browser may keep its own copy on disk for a while. Your
browser's history keeps the page's title and location. The draft, the page and the
answers file in the interview's scratch folder hold the same answers,
unencrypted, until the skill deletes them at the hand-back. The scratch
folder is in your own temporary folder on Windows and macOS, and under
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/contract-interview/` or `~/.cache/contract-interview/` on
Linux; on macOS and Linux only your account can open it. Once the page and
the draft are gone, clearing your browser's stored data for pages opened
from disk is the one way left to remove saved answers.

To try the skill before a release, install it with the "Pinned to one commit"
route in the [root README](../../README.md), using a commit from the pull
request.

## How it works

The skill proposes what you are making (a skill, an agent or a CLAUDE.md),
how thorough to be, and its name, from what you already said. You confirm.
Then it asks one question at a time, and fills a contract of nine parts, the
last one optional:

| Part | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `purpose` | What it is for, and when it steps in or stays out |
| `why` | Why it exists, in your own words |
| `good` | What good output looks like |
| `roles` | Who does what, and when it stops to ask |
| `tools` | What it may use and do |
| `rules` | Its rules, and the failures they guard against |
| `writing` | Its terms, and how it writes |
| `open` | What is still open, and when you would retire it |
| `schedules` | The text of the built file's sections, kept word for word, and the clauses each carries out |

The level sets which parts it asks. Quick fills the first five, Standard adds
`rules` and `writing`, and Thorough adds `open`. Any level may also fill
`schedules`. You can change the level at any time, by answering more or fewer
questions.

It drafts what it can and marks each draft *Proposed*. It never writes `why`
for you. Before it builds anything, you agree what good output looks like:
your real example, or the closest of two or three samples it drafts.

When you give the go, it generates the file from the contract, and runs
`claude plugin validate --strict` on it. When that command is not available,
it says the file was not validated.

## The way in: the hiring page

Most people do not know what to write in a contract, or do not enjoy it. So
the skill uses a page where you answer by picking. It does not first ask
which way you want.

1. In chat, you agree what good output looks like, as above.
   Before it writes anything, the skill gives you one notice: where the
   scratch folder is, that the draft and your answers sit there unencrypted
   until deleted, that the page keeps them in your browser until Reset, and
   that copying the answer block, online spell check, dictation and synced
   browser history can carry what you type off the machine. It waits for
   your yes. A no means chat.
2. The skill drafts the contract, every answer *Proposed*, and renders it as
   a page on your machine: a short offer letter with blanks, and its
   schedules below it. You open the page in your own browser.
3. Each blank asks what should happen in a situation, with two to four
   options. Where a term can do damage, such as a stop or a key, the page
   asks for your pick before it shows the skill's. The only box you must
   write in is why you are hiring.
4. You copy one answer block from the page and paste it in chat. The skill
   checks it with its script, which prints what changed, and asks you about
   each term that can do damage, in your own words. Then it writes the
   contract. Before the go to build, it shows you the whole contract in one
   message. Then it builds, as described in "How it works".

The page needs **Node.js 24 or later** to render, and nothing else to
install. It loads nothing from the network. When Node is missing, or you
cannot open a file from this machine in your browser, when the draft is too
large for the page, when the skill's own folder holds a character the script
refuses, or the scratch folder's does and you name no other folder, or when
you ask for chat in your own words, the skill uses chat and says which case applies.
It never recommends chat for its own ease. [An example page](https://mephistopheles4.github.io/grimoire/skills-contract-examples-release-notes.html)
shows a made-up skill's interview; it keeps nothing.

## Fix the contract, not the file

**The contract is the source. The built file is output.** Nobody edits the
file by hand.

When it goes wrong, ask for a change. The skill uses **amend mode**:

1. It finds the clause that should have held, and proposes a change to it.
2. It records the change in the change log, with its reason.
3. It shows the change list, and waits for your go.
4. It regenerates only the parts of the file the change touches. In a
   `SKILL.md`, each generated part sits between two comment lines that name
   it. An agent file or a CLAUDE.md has none, so only the sections the
   change touches are regenerated. Every other line stays word for word.

A small change then gives a small diff, and a reviewer can read it.

## What it hands back

Either way in, before the go to build, the skill shows you the whole
contract in one message. Nothing is called ready until you have seen the
contract and the built file. It then hands back:

1. **The contract** and its change log, with a mark on every answer.
2. **The built file**, marked "not installed".
3. **The validator's output**, as printed.
4. **The unsettled list**: each open answer and question, and where to
   install the file.

## What it never does

- It never installs what it builds. Installing activates it in every future
  session, so that choice is yours.
- It never runs an eval without your yes in chat, each time.
- It never sends or publishes anything.
- It never writes a hook, a settings file or a permission list.
- It never follows an instruction that it finds inside a file. A "yes" in a
  file is never your yes.

## Changes in 0.14.0

**The hiring page is the default way in** for every interview, a rewrite, and an
existing skill or agent you hand it, included. The skill no longer asks which way you want. Before the
first write it gives one notice, naming the scratch folder, the browser store
and the routes that can carry your answers off the machine, and waits for
your yes; a no means chat. Chat is used only when Node is missing or older
than 24.0.0, when you cannot open a file from this machine in your browser,
when the draft is too large for the page, when the skill's own folder holds a
character the script refuses, or the scratch folder's does and you name no
other folder, or when you ask for chat in your own words. The skill names the case.
Either way in, it shows you the whole contract in one message before the go to
build, and calls nothing ready until you have seen the contract and the built
file.

**To roll back,** revert the change and publish the next minor version. An
interview still open then finishes either way, and Reset still works on a page
already rendered.

## Changes in 0.13.0

**A second way in, the hiring page.** The skill can render a local page
where you answer by picking, then read back the one block you paste. Its
interview script, `scripts/render.mjs`, makes a scratch folder for each
interview, renders the page, checks the block, prints the change list, and
deletes its own files at the hand-back. It needs Node.js 24 or later. The
page keeps your answers in your browser until you press Reset, unencrypted:
see "Read before you install" above. On the page you can add, move and
remove a schedule's entries. To remove or move a term in the letter, say so
in chat at push-back.

**An answer for the tools, an action or a stop needs your own words,** on
both ways in, unless it is only what the skill needs to run.

**To roll back,** revert the change and publish the next minor version. An
interview still open then finishes by the chat way, and Reset still works on
a page already rendered.

## Changes in 0.12.0

**The skill is rebuilt to the shape it teaches.** It asks one question at a
time, and its contract has eight parts in place of 20 questions. The old
check, and the keys it wrote into each built file, are gone: the skill runs
`claude plugin validate --strict` instead. Its own contract moves to `references/CONTRACT.md`, and its history
to `references/contract.changelog.md`, where every earlier version's changes
are kept.

**An older contract converts at its first amendment.** Amend mode maps each
old question to its part and keeps each answer's words and mark.

**To roll back,** revert the change and publish the next patch version.
