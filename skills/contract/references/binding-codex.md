# Binding: Codex

This file maps a contract's plain words to a Codex agent file. Read it when
`tools` says the agent is built for Codex. Everything the file needs is in
the contract, the template, the skill's steps, or here. A fact missing from
all of them is a gap: stop and ask.

## Last checked

Codex 0.159.0, on 2026-09-29. Codex changes often. Name this version in the
hand-back, and say that a newer Codex may read the file differently.

## Where files go

Write where the person's agents already live: `.codex/agents/` in a
project, or `~/.codex/agents/` for the person. Ask only before a write that
would install. The contract and the change log go beside the file, as the
template says.

## The file

The file is TOML: lines of `key = value`, named `<name>.toml`.

- **Keys:** `name`, `description` and `developer_instructions` are required.
  `developer_instructions` holds the agent's instructions, the body a `.md`
  agent would have. `sandbox_mode` is known. Any other key: ask what it does
  and record it **Decided** with its value.
- **Lines:** top-level `key = value` lines, blank lines and whole-line `#`
  comments only. Codex drops an agent file with a `[metadata]` table, or a
  `metadata` key, so write no table header and no dotted or quoted key.
- **Values:** write strings. Each key once, nothing after a value, not even
  a comment.
- **Strings:** a basic string, `"…"` or `"""…"""`, takes only the escapes
  `\"` and `\\`. A literal string, `'…'` or `'''…'''`, takes none. Write
  `developer_instructions` as a `"""` string, closed with exactly three
  quotes.
- **Text:** LF or CRLF line endings, no byte-order mark, and no control or
  invisible character but tab.

## Capabilities

| Capability | In the file | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Read files, and nothing that writes | `sandbox_mode = "read-only"`, when the person names this sandbox | Loaded in Codex 0.159.0, 2026-09-29; effect not tested |
| Create files or change files | `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"`, when the person names this sandbox | Docs, read 2026-09-30: Codex's page on agent configuration |
| Run commands | No key. Commands run inside the session's sandbox, or the one `sandbox_mode` names | Docs, read 2026-09-30, same page |
| Search the web | `web_search = "live"`, when the person names it | Docs, read 2026-09-30: learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-reference |
| Fetch web pages | Nothing this file can hold. Stop and ask | Network access for a sandbox is a table, which the file may not carry |

**Ask about the sandbox.** Ask the person whether the agent gets its own
sandbox: read-only, workspace-write, or none, which leaves it to the
session. Write `sandbox_mode` only when they name one. Without it, the agent
runs in the session's sandbox, whatever that is. Say so in the hand-back.

**Limits this file cannot hold.** Say each in the hand-back, as not gated:

- The session's own choices, such as a change of permissions during the
  session, override the file's `sandbox_mode` (docs, read 2026-09-30).
- "No network": the agent takes the session's network and tool-server
  settings, and Codex's web search is on by default, as cached search, and
  live under full access (docs, read 2026-09-30).
- "Runs no commands": a read-only sandbox still lets it run commands that
  change nothing. This is a reading of the docs, not tested.

## Settings that let it act without asking

`sandbox_mode`, `default_permissions`, `approval_policy`,
`approvals_reviewer` and `web_search` change what the agent may do without
the person's approval, as do `model_instructions_file`,
`experimental_instructions_file`, `experimental_compact_prompt_file`
(each loads instructions from a file the contract does not cover),
`model_catalog_json` and `openai_base_url` (it sends the agent's work to a
server the file names). Say so when the person picks one. Record the exact
value of each one under `tools`, marked **Decided**.

## Validate

After building, run `claude plugin validate --strict` on the folder that
holds the built file, when the command is available. The validator is Claude
Code's and does not read Codex's TOML, so its verdict on this file is
partial: say so. Show any errors as printed, and fix what is the skill's own.
When the command is not available, say the file was not validated.

## Example

A reviewer that only reads, with the sandbox the person named:

```toml
name = "commit-reviewer"
description = "Reviews staged commit messages against the team's rules, and reports each message that breaks one. Use before a push. Not for writing commit messages."
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
developer_instructions = """
Read the staged commit messages. Report each one that breaks a rule, with the rule and the message.
Change no file. When a rule is unclear, list it as unsettled.
"""
```
