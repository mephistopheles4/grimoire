// eagle-eye edge audit. Zero dependencies. Box file in, a ranking of its argued
// edges out: which `why` to reread first. Opt-in, and never run without a yes.
//
//   node audit.mjs <box.json> [--json <path>] [--dry-run]
//   node audit.mjs --probe
//
//   --probe    print `yes` when a key is in the environment and `no` when it is
//              not. Reads no box and opens no connection. The skill's offer to
//              run the audit hangs on this answer.
//   --dry-run  print the request body for the first argued edge, and send it
//              nowhere. Needs no key.
//   --json     also write the ranking to <path>. The box file is never written.
//
// Exit codes, each one tested in tests/audit.test.mjs:
//
//   0  a ranking, a probe answer, or a dry run
//   1  the box file cannot be read as a box
//   2  a usage error
//   3  no key in the environment. Nothing was sent.
//   4  the service failed or refused, or its answer did not have the pinned shape
//   5  the endpoint override is not a loopback address. Nothing was read or sent.
//
// **This is the one file under skills/ that names the service it calls.** The
// model is Jev, from TypeSafe: it takes a JSON `state` and typed questions and
// returns probabilities rather than text. A Noul is its yes/no question type,
// and the answer is the probability of yes. The request and response shapes
// below are pinned against its documented HTTP contract
// (docs.typesafe.ai/api), and anything else is refused rather than guessed at.
// The skill prose says "the model provider" and never this name; see
// docs/adr/0001-skills-own-their-vocabulary.md for why code may and prose may not.
//
// What was measured, and what that allows (issue #96): the model can rank a
// box's argued edges by how well each `why` produces its relation, when it sees
// rich state and when the ranking is calibrated per box. A fixed cut-off did
// not transfer between two boxes, so every run scores the box's own shuffled
// controls and flags an argued edge that scores among them. A score is a place
// to reread first. It never moves a tier, and this file never writes a box.
//
// Environment:
//
//   TYPESAFE_API_KEY           the key. Read from here only, and never printed
//                              or written.
//   EAGLE_EYE_AUDIT_ENDPOINT   an endpoint override, for tests. Loopback only,
//                              because the URL it names receives the key and
//                              the box text.
//   EAGLE_EYE_AUDIT_CACHE      the cache directory. The default is a folder
//                              under the system temporary directory.
